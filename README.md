# CS189 Introduction to Machine Learning
This repository is my work that follows through UC Berkley's Introduction to Machine Learning course [CS189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/). I do not attend UC Berkley, however there are mutliple reasons why I decided to self-learn the material in this class.

<ol>
  <li>This was one of the courses that had public lecture videos that were available to the public. While USC does have a really strong introduction to machine learning course, the lecture videos were not public for me to self learn. </li>
  <li>The homework and class consisted of a strong balance between theoretical homework and practical. I believe that theoretical homework is important because I want to learn the underlying math behind each concept and not just utilizing libraries to omit the complexities.</li>
</ol>

Please note that these answers are not all correct. While I do try to check my work, the course page does not post the answers publicly. If you do catch any mistakes in the homework, please let me know. 

# Questions I Don't Have Answers For
This is an accumulation of all the questions that I have while working through this class. Some of these questions I tried searching online, however do not really provide a sufficient explanation but despite this I'll keep them hear.
<ol>
  <li>How can you use sklearn to train on a GPU? If it's not possible, why is it limited to only CPU usage? Is there any way to use external libraries that integrate NVIDIA GPU training?</li>
</ol>

# Homework 1 Tips
Homework 1 took a while for me as it was one of my first deep introduction to machine learning. These were some of the resources that I utilized that got me through homework 1.

Support Vector Machines is complicated. Despite it's simplicity from the outside, oftentimes the simplicity omits the complexity behind them. These were some of the videos that got me to understand the material better.

Most importantly, it is CRUCIAL in my opinion to understand the math behind SVM's. This lecture slides from San Jose State University really helped me to understand the deriviation behind SVM's. [MATH 251](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/guangliang.chen/Math251/lec5svm.pdf)
